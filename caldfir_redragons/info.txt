[DESCRIPTION:Adjust dragon growth-rates and challenge.]

[STEAM_TITLE:ReDragons Tweaks]
[STEAM_DESCRIPTION:
Minor fixes to dragons (and cave-dragons). Vanilla dragons have fallen behind compared to generated fire-breathing titans/beasts, and have difficulty just surviving worldgen. This is my attempt to bump them up to match the competition with minimal change to the flavor of DF dragons. Also some matching graphics for the new child-state and statues.

Note that trap-avoiders need some extra work in order to be caged. Dragons can be knocked-out using a cave-in, which will allow cage-traps to trigger. Hydras are not stunnable (multiple heads) so you need to use webbed traps. This added layer of complexity makes dragon-taming a real endgame accomplishment.
