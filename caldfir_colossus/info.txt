[DESCRIPTION:Enhancements to metal colossus.]

[STEAM_TITLE:ReColossus Tweaks]
[STEAM_DESCRIPTION:
Additions and enhancements to the Bronze Colossus. Adds alternate-caste versions of the Colossus for mid-tier alloys. Colossus now drops a special item (tool category) rather than a random statue. These "colossus parts" are quite valuable as a display-object, or can be melted to provide 300 bars of an appropriate metal. These alloys all melt in magma, so you'll only get the reward if you kill them the honest way ;-)

new castes:

+(bismuth-)bronze
+(fine/trifle/lay-)pewter
+brass
+hepatizon (black bronze)
+argentan (nickel silver)


tweaks:

+TRAPAVOID
+natural (+3) striker
+natural (+6) wrestler
+natural (+9) kicker
+"colossus parts" reward (under "tools")


graphics:

+recolors for each of the new castes
+"colossus parts" item
+new cleaned-up statue sprite]
